Things To Do
============

Beta 2

6.0 Spectral Bug [JRY]

Efermi
------

* Make set_efermi work for "insulator"
* compute_dos_at_efermi takes efermi (do it for each l/a/f) [AJM] <-- HAVE WE NOT DECIDED AGAINST THIS NOW?
* JDOS vbm as a functino of k [AJM]

Optados
-------

 Work out logic for computing dos before optics [JRY]


Adaptive Smearing
-----------------

* Does JDOS have the update I gave to DOS for adaptive smearing scaling (i.e. when I went from 0.4 to 1.4)? [AJM] 

Core-loss
---------

 Pretty output [JRY]


Pdos
----

 Project onto individual (real) spherical harmonics [JRY]
 Bug in PDOS parsing [JRY]

File-formats
------------

 Think about the new file formats and see if they can be made better [JRY]

========
Beta 3
=======

Check that the parameters are echo'ed in seed.odo file

Examples step by step 
 -- See Wannier90 user guide.
 * DOS/PDOS [AJM]
 * JDOS/Optics [RJN]
 * Core [JRY]

Website
  * Get the style right [AJM]
  * Charlotte's Graph?
