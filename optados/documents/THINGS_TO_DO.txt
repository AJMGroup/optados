=== CJP Coments == 
1. In the agr file, most of the labels are Helvetica (nice), but the axis labels (numbers) are times (?). Helvetica throughout would be better.
AJM -- Agreed

2. It would be nice to have a vertical dashed (red?) line for E_fermi
AJM -- This could be done.

3. Would it be better to move the box labeling the line (ie. [ -- Total Dos]) to the left hand side to reduce the change of overlap with the data?
AJM -- Unclear. Could get in the way with semicores then...

4. I may have missed how to do this - for spin polarised calculations you will want the total DOS, and spin DOS, as well as alpha, beta.
AJM -- This is a good point. Trivial to implement.

5. Following on from 4. - the total, spin and alpha, beta DOSes at Ef will want to be grep-able from the odo file.
AJM -- Also good idea.

6) Calling optados without an odi file should execute default behaviour. I suggest, calculating the DOS with our recommended settings. 
AJM -- Not sure about this -- how does it know which seed file to open?  I'd rather have it fail safe than do something that's not 100% clear.

7) Can you add a gaussian smearing to the linear extrapolation with the current code? I didn't figure out how to do this. If not, it needs to be added.
AJM -- Have discussed this with CJP. Important to do, must be done semi-analytically.

8) I suggest we make the linear broadening the default - it does not require a parameter to be set smearing for reasonable results.
(This suggestion follows after calculating the DOS for the Al example supplied using the following odi:
TASK : dos
#BROADENING : linear
COMPUTE_BAND_GAP : true
try it yourself to see what I mean - the linear makes a much better impression. Can you suggest counter examples?).
AJM: I'm coming round to the idea that linear is better -- once we've addressed point 7, linear should be made default. (unless there are good counter examples.)

9) Can we make COMPUTE_BAND_GAP : true the default? It costs nothing to calculate, so see no reason not to supply it. You might even consider removing the parameter altogether.
AJM: Both good points.

10) TASK : dos should be the default (currently the default task it to do nothing).
AJM: Unclear. I think "all" is probably a better default.

11) I am not convinced about the naming strategy of the output. I don't think I user really cares about whether the results are adaptive/linear, but rather about the physics quantity. So we should stick to: .dos.agr, .jdos.agr, .core.agr etc.
AJM: Not if we continue with TASK: compare_dos . There needs to be a way to differentiate. 

12) The .dat files should only be generated if requested through the OUTPUT_FORMAT parameter. Could we allow the request of multiple formats?
AJM: I'm divided over this. It would be cleaner not to have them, if the user requests a graphical format. But they're essentially free, and I find them useful.

13) Calculating the band gaps seems to rely on the supplied kpoint grid only. It would be good to make an attempt based on the extrapolation - certainly we can do this for the thermal gap, from the DOS (i.e. how many bins are exactly zero in the gap region).
AJM: I don't understand this. I don't think many bins turn out to be exactly zero. This may get better with CJP's band kissing tweaks.

14) Exectuting: "optados" produces (in a err file)

 OptaDOS: Execution started on 14 Apr 2013 at 10:04:38 
 Exiting.......
 Error: Problem opening input file optados.odi

I suggest sending error information to STDERR.
(a) AJM: This is not the CASTEP way, nor the usual way to deal with errors in a parallel code. Of course, I think there is a case to think about how optados behaves when called argumentless. Other errors shouldn't exist!

People can then choose to take not, or send to /dev/null. I would also prefer if the output is sent to STDOUT, but feel less strongly about this.
(b) AJM: Again not the CASTEP way. I find the output file useful.

Also - in this case optados should simply report how to use the program. It take quite a bit of digging at the moment to find out what it wants the user to do.
AJM: I think there is a strong case to have optados write out a brief "help message" to STDERR if called argumentless. I prefer this to comment (6).
