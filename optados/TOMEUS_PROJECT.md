Dear Andrew,

You are correct, we do not want the division by the difference in energy eigenstates, I think we only need the matrix elements as they appear in Eq. (2.8) of the OPTADOS user guide. Furthermore, I don’t think we have to worry about dimensions/etc.; all we care about really are the relative values of these matrix elements between “static” (where they should be zero for some), “0K”, and “300K”.

I would be happy to have a Skype meeting if you think that would help.

Best wishes,
Tomeu
